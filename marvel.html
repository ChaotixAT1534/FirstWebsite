<h1>Marvel Rivlas</h1>
<p>This is currently my favorite game. I like this game because it has fan favorite characters from marvel such as Iron Man, Spider-man, The Hulk and more. My rank in this game is diamond 1. It could be higher rank but I am busy with work and classes. My main is Psylocke and her main role is dps (damage per second) character. A dps role is to do lots of damage and in this game doing a lot of damage and eliminating the supports is good.</p>
