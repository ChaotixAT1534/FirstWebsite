<h1>Other games I played</h1>
<p>I played the game called Skate and I find it fun. It was introduced to me by my cousin and I enjoyed the game. It is a skateboard simulation game and you just skate and complete challenges. </p>
    
<p>Street Fighter 6 is another game I played. 
 The first street fighter game I played was Street Fighter 4. This game is a fighting game where strategy and patience can change the match. Learning combos is this game is really difficult but I challenged myself to try  </p>
